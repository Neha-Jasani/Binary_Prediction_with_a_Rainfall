# Binary_Prediction_with_a_Rainfall

## Overview

Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series! This competition provides an opportunity to practice machine learning skills with interesting and approachable datasets. The challenge for this competition is to predict rainfall for each day of the year.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to build an accurate machine learning model for predicting daily rainfall based on various weather-related features. By leveraging data preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning techniques, we aim to improve prediction accuracy.

## Data Analysis & Preprocessing

* **Dataset Overview:** The dataset contains weather-related features such as pressure, temperature, humidity, cloud cover, sunshine, wind direction, wind speed, and rainfall.
* **Missing Values Handling:** One missing value in the winddirection column was imputed using the median.
* **Feature Engineering:** Created interaction features such as:
  * humidity_cloud_interaction (interaction between humidity and cloud cover)
  * humidity_sunshine_interaction (interaction between humidity and sunshine)
  * cloud_sunshine_ratio (ratio of cloud cover to sunshine)
  * relative_dryness (inverse measure of humidity)
  * sunshine_percentage (proportion of sunshine relative to cloud cover)
  * weather_index (weighted combination of humidity, cloud cover, and sunshine)

## Machine Learning Approach

* **Feature Scaling:** Standardized numerical features using StandardScaler.
* **Model Selection:** Implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense, and Dropout layers.
* **Optimization Techniques:**
  * Used ReLU activation and Adam optimizer for efficient training.
  * Implemented Early Stopping and Learning Rate Reduction to prevent overfitting.

## Tools & Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
* **Visualization Techniques:** Heatmaps, Correlation Plots, Feature Distributions
* **Model Training:** Deep Learning (CNN), Feature Engineering, Standardization

## Results & Insights

* Extracted meaningful features to enhance rainfall prediction.
* Improved model performance through feature scaling and interaction terms.
